Hi there, I'm <a href="http://www.semihsevinc.click/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Semih</a> 👋
</h3>

<h2 align="center">
I'm a Electrical Electronics Engineer 📚, Interested in Embedded Systems 💻, and Biker 🚲
</h2> 

i have been able to learn how to communicate effectively due to the fact that I have led many teams during my university education. Apart from my education, I am developing myself in machine learning, image processing, data science and of course electronic hardware design.

I have been involved in project and team management on many projects, I have learned that the priorities in the project and the work completed should be measured by the work, not by time. I like to create innovative solutions in an effective team.
